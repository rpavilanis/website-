      Hello! My name is Rachel Pavilanis. I am an aspiring software developer, attending the Seattle-based <a href="http://www.adadevelopersacademy.org">Ada Developer's Academy</a> as a member of Cohort 6. Ada Developer's Academy is a year-long software development training program, with six months of intensive in-class work followed by a five month internship at a sponsoring Seattle-based company. In this program, I am learning Ruby, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS. I am also gaining practical experience working on project teams and a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals. I will graduate in July of 2017, and will then be working as a full-stack software developer.  See my resume <a href="https://gist.github.com/rpavilanis/0d783da551eda6e65e57">here.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Prior to this new venture, I worked in the field of school psychology for five years, providing school-based school psychology support while also adding district responsibilities like Positive Behavior Interventions and Support (PBIS) Coach and Preschool Transition Coordinator.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am originally from Michigan, but I have lived in the Eugene, Oregon area for approximately eight years, with my partner and two small dogs.  In my spare time, I love to read fantasy novels, explore the beautiful Pacific Northwest, and <a href = "http://www.soundcloud.com/rachel-pavilanis">write/record songs</a>.
